# Motivated Incidental Consolidation (MIC)
This repository contains the code for the "Motivated Incidental Consolidation (MIC)" project.

## Scope of project

In the course of the project, a new paradigm was developed to investigate the effects of motivation (i.e., the subjective feeling of curiosity and the availability of extrinsic incentives) on learning. Participants viewed a series of magic trick videos and performed a judgement task including curiosity ratings. The performance in the judgement task was incentivised for half of the participants. fMRI data was aquired before, during, and after learning. A week later, memory for the magic tricks was tested using a surprise memory test. Changes in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between dopaminergic midbrain (VTA/SN) and anterior hippocampus (aHPC) were correlated with behavioural measures of learning.
